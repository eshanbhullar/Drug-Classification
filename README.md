# Drug Classification Project

## Project Title

**Drug Classification Using Machine Learning**

## Description

This project aims to classify drug types based on various health metrics using machine learning models. The dataset includes information such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, and sodium-to-potassium ratio for patients. The goal is to predict the drug that a patient is likely to be prescribed based on these factors.

The project uses algorithms such as Neural Networks (MLPClassifier) and Decision Trees (DecisionTreeClassifier) to perform the classification task.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you in setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your computer, along with the following libraries:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: For numerical computing
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
- **matplotlib**: For visualizations

You can install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
